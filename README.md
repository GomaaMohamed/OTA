## Block Definition Diagram for the System

## Key Features

1. **Confidentiality (3DES):**
   - Utilizes Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) to ensure the confidentiality of
     firmware updates and diagnostic data during transmission over the air.

2. **Integrity (SHA256):**
   - Implements SHA-256 hashing algorithm to verify the integrity of firmware updates
     and diagnostic messages, safeguarding against unauthorized alterations during transmission.

3. **Authentication (HMAC and Certificate):**
   - Implements HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) for message authentication,
     ensuring that messages are from legitimate sources.
   - Utilizes digital certificates to authenticate and verify the identity of
     communicating devices, preventing unauthorized access.

## Components

1. **Python Application (MQTT Client):**
   - Acts as an MQTT client responsible for encrypting Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) frames and
     firmware updates before transmitting them over the MQTT protocol.
   - Decrypts the responses received from connected devices.

2. **MQTT Broker:**
   - Serves as the central communication hub, facilitating secure and reliable communication
     between the Python Application, ESP32, and STM32F103 devices.
   - Supports MQTT protocols for efficient and lightweight messaging.

3. **ESP32 (MQTT Client):**
   - Functions as an MQTT client and plays a vital role in the bidirectional communication process.
   - Decrypts incoming UDS frames and firmware updates before processing them.

4. **STM32F103 (ECU):**
   - Represents the Electronic Control Unit targeted for diagnostics and firmware updates.
   - Interacts with the Python Application and ESP32 to perform diagnostics
     and receive firmware updates securely.

## Use Cases

- **Firmware Updates:**
  - Enables over-the-air firmware updates for the STM32F103 ECU,
    ensuring a secure and streamlined process.
  
- **Diagnostics:**
  - Facilitates diagnostic operations on the STM32F103 ECU, allowing for
    real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Security Considerations

- The use of 3DES ensures confidential transmission of sensitive data.
- SHA256 guarantees the integrity of transmitted messages,
  protecting against tampering.
- HMAC and digital certificates authenticate the origin of messages,
  preventing unauthorized access.
